# CodeAlpha_Student-Grade-Tracker
This is a Java-based console application developed as part of my internship with CodeAlpha. The project allows users to manage and track student grades effectively. It features functionalities like inputting student data, calculating average scores, identifying the highest and lowest marks, and generating a summary report.
